In this project we built a website that is about sport. It is for those who are interested in sports. This application is made by html and css/sass

## 1- My demo

You can see my demo by clicking this github link with the username [Betsimisaraka](https://github.com/Betsimisaraka/front-end-assessment)

## 1- Explaination about the structure of my project.
This project structures as the folowing instruction below:

First, I have a folder called `source-materials` which contains two other folder that are the imagery and the fonts folder. Inside of this we can see all the necessary fonts and images that we are going to use in the project.

And then, there is a folder called `scss` in which all of my scss files stored.

Lastly `Webroot` folder this is the bigest folder and the most useful in this application. This contains the `index.html` file, `img` folder which store the images that have been compiled, also `fonts` folder this also contains all of the fonts that have been converted into `woff` and `woff2` and lastly the `css` folder where you can see the conversion of the `scss` into `css`.

## 1- My experience

My experience during this project was the way I positioned the background images in each part. Especialy with the site header and the first section. I was struggle to position them at first.

## 1- What have I learned/improved are:

Positioning the background in the right position is still new for me and I learned that in this project. Also using flex basis property with display flex layout I learned that as well.
