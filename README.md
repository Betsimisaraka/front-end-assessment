# Front-end assessment

A mockup-to-website example to be used as an assessment of our student's capabilities

## Getting started

- Fork this repo to your own github account
- Clone your github account version of the repo (e.g. `STUDENT_NAME/front-end-assessment` ) to your computer.
- Work in your `main` branch

## The design

I'd recommend downloading the Figma App if you haven't already.

### On Figma.com

You can [find the mockup on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SC3HqLUP9hGBfn93mIwxkS/Sports-App-homepage-Responsive-Revised)

### As a `.fig` file

You can [find the `.fig` file in the source folder of this repo](source/sports-app.fig).

Open the `.fig` in the Figma App, or import it/drag it into the Figma.com workspace in your browser.
