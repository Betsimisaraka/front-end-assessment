In this project we built a website that is about sport. It is for those who are interested in sports. This application is made by html and css/sass

-   My demo

You can see my demo by clicking this github link with the username [Betsimisaraka](https://github.com/Betsimisaraka/front-end-assessment)

- My experience

My experience during this project was the way I positioned the background images in each part. Especialy with the site header and the first section. I was struggle to position them at first.

-   What have you learned/improved?

Positioning the background in the right position is still new for me and I learned that in this project. Also using flex basis property with display flex layout I learned that as well.

### Built With

-   [Html](https://html.org/)
-   [Css/Sass](https://css.org)

## The design

I'd recommend downloading the Figma App if you haven't already.

### On Figma.com

You can [find the mockup on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SC3HqLUP9hGBfn93mIwxkS/Sports-App-homepage-Responsive-Revised)

### As a `.fig` file

You can [find the `.fig` file in the source folder of this repo](source-materials/sports-app.fig).

Open the `.fig` in the Figma App, or import it/drag it into the Figma.com workspace in your browser.

## Resources

I've extracted all the images in multiple formats, and placed them in the `source-material/imagery` folder.

So too with downloading the fonts. Have a look in the `source-material/fonts` folder.

## Development

The `webroot` folder is where all your work should go. You'll notice there's already an `index.html` and the supporting folders inside the `webroot`.
