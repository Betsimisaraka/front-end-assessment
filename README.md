## 1- My demo

You can see my demo by clicking this github link with the username [Betsimisaraka](https://github.com/Betsimisaraka/front-end-assessment)

## 1- Explaination about the structure of my project.
This project is structured as the folowing instruction below:

Firstly, I have a folder called `scss` in which all of my scss files stored.

Secondly, there is a folder called `source-materials` which contains three subfolders that are the `images`, the `fonts` and the `icons`. Inside of these we can see all the necessary fonts, images and icons that are necessary on building this project.


Lastly `Webroot` folder this is the bigest folder that store the web-files in this application. This contains the `index.html` file, `img` folder which store the images that have been compiled, also `fonts` folder this also contains all of the fonts that have been formated and converted into `woff` and `woff2` and lastly the `css` folder where you can see the output of the `scss` files. I also use a `script` file which has a little bit of javascript to make the image slider works.

## 1- My experience

My experience during this project was the calculations that I use to positioned the background images in the masthead and in the user friendly interface.

## 1- The most challenging part

The most challenging part while I was working with this project was to position the background image correctly. I also had some difficulties to get the alignment of the featured section to align nicely.

## 1- What have I learned or improved are:

In this project, I have learned how to compress an image by `paint.net` application. And also, I learned how to format fonts from `ttf` to `woff` and `woff2`. I learned how to calculate the position of the background image by using `x` and `y` axis.
